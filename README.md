# HAR_SAG_Data
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (Accelerometer &amp; Gyroscope) Data  

The purpose of the run_analysis.r script is to create a single, tidy table that summarizes the HAR information of all the mean and std variables, per subject per activity, using averages

CodeBook.md describes the raw data used as input for the run_analysis.r script and it explains the processing done by the script to the raw data to generate the HAR_tidydata.txt file as output, which is also contained in this repo.

Finally, all the columns of the HAR_tidydata.txt are also described in the final section of the CodeBook.md file.
